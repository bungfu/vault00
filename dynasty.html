          cannot leave it to chance, cannot fuck with a bitch who owns an only fans<br>
          stick this dick in your mouth for your next meal plan<br>

          bouncin from wall to wall<br>
          just checked out with a salvo's haul, ay<br>
           <br>
          cream of the crop, butter the loaf<br>
          pray to your god, utter the oath<br>
          all finger chopped, top up the bowl<br>
          spliff running hot, pass it like scholes<br>
           <br>
          put em up, fuck em up<br>

           <br>
          spit a couple bars in the kitchen<br>
          michelin star for my dishes<br>
          might jet off to Mars in a minute<br>
          and cut off these ties to all you bitches<br>
          ahh you must be shittin' me<br>

          new tab on chrome, that's LSD<br>
           <br>
          incognito no history<br>
          i write my own eulogy<br>
          i set it in stone my mausoleum<br>
          try to catch these jokes, like<br>
           <br>
