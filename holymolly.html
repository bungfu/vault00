            ay, what's it with all the tension?<br>
            all you motherfuckers want is attention<br>
            two fake smiles for a mention<br>
            no real clout fuck that's demented<br>
            move me to another dimension<br>
            suicide never been the intention<br>
            i been down ever since my inception<br>
            i been real i been keeping it precious<br>
             <br>
            i been cut, i been keeping it raw<br>
            are you kidding me, are you sure?<br>
            no I'm not, yes, oh my lord<br>
            put em up let's settle the -<br>
             <br>
            bag you up and send you on your way<br>
            loosen up, you been looking for change<br>
            too far gone and you don't have the range<br>
            could not meet her you could not gauge<br>
             <br>
            st vinnies from my neck down<br>
            fangin for your feed that's a let down<br>
            not white enough put the ket down<br>
            shaky knees get another set down<br>
             <br>
            bag you up and send you on your way<br>
            loosen up, you been looking for change<br>
            too far gone and you don't have the range<br>
            could not meet her you could not gauge<br>
             <br>
            this shit is a creeper, let it dig in deeper<br>
            decked out in fila, messi on fifa<br>
            my girl she a keeper<br>
            no typical sheila, keeping it realer<br>
            medicinal healer<br>
            your grass is green, my grass is greener<br>
            dressed all black like rieder, can't see me like cena, ay<br>
             <br>
            ain't nobody cleaner<br>
            dean blunt the redeemer, follow the leader<br>
            your girl looking keener, twist that top ribena<br>
            dream on, dreamer<br>
            sold out the arena, did it all no feature<br>
            turn up the speaker, see you when I see ya<br>
            cut you off in the kia, ay<br>
             <br>
            fuck it up on the one time<br>
            fuck it up on the two time<br>
            call me the two time<br>
            blowing up on your timeline<br>
            didn't read the whole guideline<br>
            hop in the Skyline<br>
            walking through on a fine line<br>
            keep you off on the sideline<br>
            driving a red light<br>
            got some shit in the pipeline<br>
            fuck it up with no lifeline, ay<br>
             <br>
            switched up from street to medicinal<br>
            spirit so holy, it's biblical<br>
            working got dirt in my cuticle<br>
            vessel for heat I'm the crucible<br>
            step back for the BUNG FU DYNASTY<br>
            step forward ever so righteously<br>
            reigning on top only rightfully<br>
            loyalty leave you a casualty<br>
